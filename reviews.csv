5.0,"Very good ac, its new and its cooling is excellent. If you know how to use a AC efficiently, this is a great choice. I set it at 27 degrees, and it uses around 12% of the rated load after a few hours at night. I hope its keep working like this. Did not use any extra voltage stabilisers, since its built in. Looks clean and neat. At lowest fan setting the noise in db is very low.Daikin scheduled the installation after 3 days of ac arrival. I cancelled the installation and used a 3rd party professional (urbanclap)for installation. Good experience. One more thing, the PCB board was loose inside the outdoor unit, and the fan blade was striking it while rotating, I was lucky that there was no damage and installation guys were also surprised by this but anyway they open the cover and fixed the plastic rivet, free of cost.Read more"

1.0,Delivered on time and installation was done same day but technician came with no vaccum machine and installed without vaccum. after 2 month use outdoor started producing noise and indoor swing motor stoped working it produce noise also while working and product quality is very cheap it's plastic material is also cheap quality. better purchase it from nearest store. after some research I found online unit and available at nearest store both are not same even models are different.Read more
4.0,Even though I purchased the product online the service from Daikin was spot on ....both installation and warranty service (general check up....nothing wrong with the product). They charged around 5K for the installation (due to the extra piping and cabling work) but did a very good job. Once your product is registered with Daikin you get prompt warranty check up and reminders ( which is good).Using it for a room size of 12ft x 12 ft x 12 ft on the top floor (terrace exposed to sun) and the cooling effect is very good. Also the blower is very silent.Read more

1.0,"Where do I even begin?I rarely write reviews, but after the nightmare I’ve had with Daikin, I feel it’s my responsibility to warn others. And to make things worse — my previous review mysteriously disappeared from Amazon. Not sure if it was removed, but it’s incredibly suspicious.1. Missing Essential Components:The AC was delivered without basic parts like the copper pipe. How do you ship an AC unit without something so fundamental? This delayed the entire installation process unnecessarily.2. Clueless Installation Team:When the installation team finally came, they were unprepared — no core cutting tools. Even worse, Daikin does not allow installation by third-party professionals, so you’re stuck with their unprofessional service. They had to leave installation in between and left the house in mess. Pic attached.3. No Customer Service:I’ve written multiple complaints over the last month. Not a single response. Zero accountability. It's like once they’ve sold the unit, they just vanish.4. Hidden/Extra Charges:The installation team tried to charge for every little thing e.g. installation of wall brackets. Why am I even paying a separate “installation fee” if everything is extra?5. Review Censorship?:My earlier, honest review is no longer visible. That alone says a lot about how Daikin handles feedback.I expected professionalism from a premium brand. Instead, I got delays, poor service, zero support, and extra charges. If you're considering Daikin — don’t. Save yourself the stress and go with a brand that actually values its customers.Read more"
4.0,"Product & it's performance is very good. Installation was Ok, could have been much professional.The swing movement of left & right, up & down works well.The only con is compressor takes takes 2-3 mins to start hence cooling in the initial minutes is delayed compared to other brands like LG where compressor & cool aur starts in 30seconds.The temperature performance is amazing. 24° in room with roof exposure gives you chills.One can just go for it, the cooling & air flow is very good.Read more"
